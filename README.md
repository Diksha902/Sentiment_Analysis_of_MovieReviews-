This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews to determine whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis helps gauge the public's perception of movies, enabling better decision-making for movie production, marketing strategies, and audience engagement.

By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the project aims to classify the sentiment of movie reviews effectively and efficiently.
